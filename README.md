## To-Do

how to split up router.js effectively

deo div tags or whatever for each question
find the appropriate  formatting to make them look decently nice

Add the rest of the survey crap to those webpages

Format the queestions and the blocks of questions.

Work out those links for the sequential pages. (With the last one directing to the survey)

General organization, the whole project still seems foggy.

The content, of course
