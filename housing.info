Canidacy for afforable housing is often thought of in percentages - what percent of income is devoted to housing? 30% is considered cost burdened. About
12 million households in the US pay more than 50% of their income
towards housing.

Support for homeless is generally seperate, there are seperate organizations for that. (Maybe have a slide of resources for homelessness)

What is HUD Doing to Support Affordable Housing?
Within the Office of Community Planning and Development, the Office of Affordable Housing Programs (OAHP) administers the following grant programs designed to increase the stock of housing affordable to low-income households.

    The HOME Investments Partnerships Program (HOME) provides grants to States and local governments to fund a wide range of activities including 1) building, buying, and/or rehabilitating housing for rent or homeownership or 2) providing direct rental assistance to low-income families. It is the largest Federal block grant program for State and local governments designed exclusively to create affordable housing for low-income households.
    The National Housing Trust Fund (HTF) supports the acquisition, new construction, or reconstruction of rental units for extremely low-income families or families with incomes below the poverty line, whichever is greater.

HUD's Office of Housing and Office of Public and Indian Housing also administer programs to increase the amount of affordable housing available for low-income households across the nation.

so a good way to do this would be basically walking one through how they would find cheap housing for themselves, from lowest income to highest. So govt assisted stuff first, such as section 8, and progressively more til just browsing apartments i guess.

Income would therefore be the first thing addressed, and once the user knew what type of housing he might be looking for, then resouces to search for them are provided.
