Both surveys and info should be kept in a single text file, which is on github and maybe another backup.

each new submission causes an additional line to be appended to the text file, in a certain style

cleanse the strings of tildes, and then use them as separators between different properties on the same line

this is important need to do this stuff

i can use any language i want to analyze the data, python should be it,
good graphing capabilities as well as just easy in general

the info page really needs work REALLY!

so do the content pages. how are we going to place those directional links??
