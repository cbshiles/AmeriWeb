move info stuff to the first page, and remember their info for the whole time
	right now its just submitting the indo @ the beginning
		for laziness id like to keep it this way if possible

make sure page #s are set correctly in server code, and fill out some example surveys, and check the text files to verify that theyre saving correctly

once thats working, edit the slides til they can actually be presented


remember python's graphing capabilities

fix that final page after completeing survey
	its working, just needs touch up like the rest

***needs to not crash when it cant find a file

need to split the survey data text file into two seperate ones,
	one for each survey
