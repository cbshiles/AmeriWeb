complete rest of slides for housing [this is the most diffult task remaining, and it is the first you will do]

this will put you at a very rough draft state

make sure page #s are set correctly in server code, and fill out some example surveys, and check the text files to verify that theyre saving correctly

once thats working, edit the slides til they can actually be presented

on taking surveys: (making sure forms are filled out)
i want client side javascript to check if certain variables from the form have been set,
and only actually submit the data if they have. otherwise have a popup box complaining

remember python's graphing capabilities

at the end, put a link to the other presentation
