remember python's graphing capabilities

so do the content pages. how are we going to place those directional links??

id also like to stylize those next and back links

the very front page sux, but no biggie
so does the info page, chop chop

tonight's focus is going to crank out a few pages for each of these presentations

one part of this will be figuring out how to use a variable number of slides for that loop that provides links
