move info stuff to the first page, and remember their info for the whole time

for survey, have darker background and the questions have to lighter backgrouond. need to have decent margins to showthis off

make sure page #s are set correctly in server code, and fill out some example surveys, and check the text files to verify that theyre saving correctly

once thats working, edit the slides til they can actually be presented


remember python's graphing capabilities

fix that final page after completeing survey
    at the end, put a link to the other presentation
