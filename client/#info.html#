Needs to provide date(can be server side), ask name, youth or adult, services provided will be ee for the energ slides, ah for the others
This will be a form, that is done on client side and sent over to the server
this is info.html, the only file you need for the home updates

the services provided will be the only diference between the different survey's version of this page

Probably send that information through a get or whatever, so that i can be the same page

<form action="info_form.js" method="get">
  <input type="text" name="fullname"><br>

  <input type="radio" name="age" value="youth"> Youth<br>
  <input type="radio" name="age" value="adult">Adult<br>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">

  When the form is actually sent, it also needs to send services provided and possibly the date
</form>

   
	    if (isSlide){
		if (slideNum > 0){
		    var sn = (slideNum-1).toString()
		    res.write(cat(["<b href='", id, sn, "'></b>"]));//have a back redirect
		    //# need to actually lookup link tags
		}
		    
		pages = 10 //# need to remove later, or just make them equal
		
		if (slideNum < pages) // need to actually set pages (max # of pages) above
		{
		    var sn = (slideNum+1).toString()
		    res.write(cat(["<a href='", id, sn, "'>Next</a>"]));//have a forward redirect
		}

		//		include('slideA.js') //js prep, defintions etc
		res.write(data) //write actual text file's content
		//		include('slideB.js') //js execution, after setting of variables in data
	    }
