  <p>The choice of a lightbulb can greatly affect how much energy a fixture uses. Here are the three main types of bulbs. </p>

  <ol>
    <li><b>Incandescent: </b> These are traditional light bulbs. They are cheap to buy, but they can by expensiv to use, as they are inefficient. </li></br>
    <li><b>Compact Flourescent: </b>Use much less energy than an incandescent bulb, and last up to 9 years. When used up, they must be recycled to be disposed of safely. </li></br>
    <li><b>LED: </b> Most efficient and long lasting bulb (up to 20 years). Can be expensive, and some find the light from a LED harsh, but it is an evolving technology and both aspects are improving. </li></br>
  </ol>
