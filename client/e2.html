<h2>Water Use & Appliances </h2>

<br/>

<p> Americans have access to incredible amounts of water when compared to people from most other parts of the world. We should be grateful and use this blessing wisely. It is easy in such prosperity to take such things for granted. Doing so, however, leads to wasteful habits. For example, <a href="http://www.data360.org/dsg.aspx?Data_Set_Group_Id=757"> the US uses over 3 times as much water per person as the United Kingdom.</a></p>

  <ul>
    <li> Be mindful of the water you use daily. Wasted water can come from daily activities that are so habitual that we don't think of how much water we are wasting. Things to look for are running sinks, long showers, leaky hoses, etc.</li></br>

<li>Know where your water cut-off is, and use it occasionally to ensure that it is in proper working condition. Being able to use the water cut-off is important when you have a leak or your pipes have frozen.</li></br>

    <li>Use ENERGY STAR appliances. ENERGY STAR is an EPA program that tests and approves appliances as meeting their standards of energy efficiency, including water use.</li></br>

    <li>It is common to leave appliances plugged in, even if they won't be used for some time. While it may not be much electricity the appliance is using at a time, it adds up if it is plugged in for long periods of idle time.</li></br>

    <li>
      Use surge protectors. They can keep devices from being fried when electricity surges, and allow you to turn multiple devices off with one switch.
