<h1> Affordable Housing: <br/> Locating Affordable Housing for Yourself or Another </h1>

<!-- LOOK AT HOUSING.INFO -->

<p>
Affordable housing for lower income individuals and families is a huge issue in the United States. About 12 million households in the US pay more than 50% of their income towards housing. Being able to find affordable housing for you or another requires finding the organizations that support people in your/their particular situation. A person or family's income will determine what programs are available to them, as most programs have a maximum income level. It is important if the applicant is a senior citizen (55+ years old), is a family, or has special needs. Therefore, identifying the applicant's specific situation is the first step in finding affordable housing. </p>

Next, is to search out the local organizations which are directed towards helping people of that situation, or at least accept them into their program. There are many organizations that help to provide affordable housing, and contacting as many relevant organizations as possible is the best way to help one receive aid. </p>
