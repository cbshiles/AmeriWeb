  Keeping windows and doors well insulated can result in major savings in the winter months.

  Upkeep of weather striping and caulk sealant and using window covers can help increase savings.

  Curtain and blinds stuff, already mentioned.

  In the winter, opening a window is a very ineffcient way of cooling a room.

  doors can be a major way that outside air comes into the house, making it more difficult to heat/cool the house.

  Periodically check your weatherstripping and make sure you door closes without gaps.
