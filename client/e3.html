  Keeping windows and doors well insulated can result in major savings in the winter months. It is also important to not leave windows and doors open when it is particularly hot or cold.

  Upkeep of weather striping and caulk sealant, and using window covers or blinds  can help increase savings.

  Doors can be a major way that outside air comes into the house, making it more difficult to heat/cool the house. Periodically check your weatherstripping and make sure you door closes without gaps.
