<h2> Resources for the Homeless </h2>

<p>
  Homelessness in America is, for the most part, not a chronic situation. Many people, especially families, exit homelessness quickly. The number of homeless through an entire year is a fourth or fifth of the homeless population on any given day. Job loss and mental illness cannot entirely account for these large numbers of sporadically homeless people. It is the state of the housing market that makes poor working people unable to afford housing.

  Since most public assistance programs are geared towards families, they are more likely to be able to avoid homelessness, or at least get out of it quickly. It is unattached adults that are more likely to be homeless, and to be homeless for longer periods of time. First time homelessness can often be treated with rent subsidies, help dealing with landlords, or information on public services.

  People who are homeless for the first time and experiencing a single crisis may need relatively simple remedies, such as rental assistance, help negotiating with landlords, or referrals to public benefits or services. These all tie into the general issue of affordable housing, and have similar solutions. Persons with repeated or long episodes of homelessness, however, are likely to need considerably more support for longer periods of time. These resources tend to the immediate needs of the homeless, as well as provide the support to work towards a more stable situation.
