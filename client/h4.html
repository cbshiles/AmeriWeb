<h2> Habitat for Humanity </h2>

<p>
  Habitat for Humanity is an international non-profit Christian organization that primarily builds new houses for impovershed families.

  Families must meet certain specifications when it comes to income level and needs. For example, a family with a slightly higher income but an additional 2 kids might be deemed a more 'in need' family. 

<br/><br/>



Families are not given the houses, but spend time doing construction and taking classes on talking care of a house and money management. They purchase the house and pay off a mortgage. What makes Habitat affordable is that the house is priced at the cost to build it, and the mortgage for the house is interest free.

Habitat relies on volunteer efforts for much of their construction process. It is a great way to gain construction skills while assisting in the community. To volunteer or to look into the homeowner's application process, visit your local Habitat's <a href="http://www.habitat.org/where-we-build/united-states-canada">website. </a>
