<h2>Heating and Cooling Tips</h2>

<br/>

  <ul>
    <li>For each degree that you turn your thermostat down in the winter, you can save 2% to 3% on your heating bill.</li><br/><br/>
  <li>Opening your blinds and curtains can increase light and heat in your home. Generally, it is best to leave them open in the winter and closed in the summer.</li>
  <br/> 
    <li>Having shade trees near one's house can help keep sun off. Deciduous trees are the most effective, since they lose their leaves in winter, letting the sunlight through when you want it.</li><br/>

    <li> Insulation and well sealed doors are key for efficient heating. </li><br/>
    
    <li> Change your air filters every 3 months. An HVAC unit has to use extra energy to push air through a clogged filter, and your air won't be as clean.</li><br/>
         <li>On the same note, it is important to make sure your intake and output vents are free from blocks and obstructions.</li><br/>
    <li>Change the direction your ceiling fan turns. A clockwise direction in the winter pulls the cool air at the bottom of the room up to the ceiling, allowing warmer air without experiencing a breeze. A counterclockwise direction is better for summer, since it pushes air down onto you, creating a cooling wind.</li><br/><br/>
