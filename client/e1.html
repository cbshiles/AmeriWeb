<h2>Heating and Cooling Tips</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>For each degree that you turn your thermostat down in the winter, you can save 2% to 3% on your heating bill.</li><br/>
  <li>Opening your blinds and curtains can increase light and heat in your home. Generally, it is most efficient to leave them open in the winter and closed in the summer.</li>
  <br/>  
    <li>Having shade trees near one's house can help keep sun off. Decidous trees are the most effective, since they lose their leaves in winter, letting the sunlight through when you want it.</li><br/>
    <li> Change your air filters every 3 months, to keep one's heating/air unit from overworking, and to keep the air in your home clean.</li><br/>
    <li>Change the direction your ceiling fan turns. (Or reverse the tilt on the blades of the fan).</li><br/>
    
</ul>
