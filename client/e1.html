<!--   Have one with all the outside stuff, taking advantage of natural light and the summner /winter stuff
  (maybe ceiling fans herer) -->

<h2>The 1 with outside stuff </h2>

<ul>
  <li>Opening your blinds and curtains can increase light and heat in your home. Generally, it is most efficient to leave them open in the winter and closed in the summer.</li>

  <li>Having shade trees near one's house can help keep sun off. Decidous trees are the most effective, since they lose their leaves in winter, letting the sunlight through when you want it.</li>
</ul>
